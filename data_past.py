Read the prepared data files

There are 3 data sources (PDP7A, EVN 2016 report, IEA statistics)
so we need to clarify column names.

 1/ Some include Imports in electricity "Production"
    Here we don't --it's clearly wrong-- and use these column names:
      Supply = Production + Imports

 2/ Another ambiguity is whether SmallHydro is included in "Hydro" or "Renewable"
    Here we do the former and use these column names:
      Hydro = BigHydro + SmallHydro
      BigHydro = LargeHydro + InterHydro
      Renewable = Wind + Solar + Biomass
      Renewable4 = Renewable + Small hydro

 3/ We do NOT include PumpedStorage in Hydro capacities

 4/ We define Import as net of Exports

 5/ In VN capacity stats, generation from fuel oil and from diesel is not clearly accounted for

 6/ Adding up fossil fuel generation capacities with renewable capacities is meaningless
    because the capacity factors are not comparable, neither are the investment costs

"""The annual electricity production increased to 164.31 TWh in 2015.
In 2015, coal accounted for the largest share of electricity production (34.4%),
followed by hydropower (30.4%) and gas (30%). Apart from large-scale hydropower,
renewable energy - including small-scale hydropower - represented only a minor part
of the electricity production (3.7%).
The figure adds that: Imports represented 1.5%, we infer that the production number is the total
