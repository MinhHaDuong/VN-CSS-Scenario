Differences between PDP7A et EVN 2016 report:

The EVN report does not list IPP or BOT projects.

ND Duyen Hai III #2 listed in 2017 in PDP, in 2016 in EVN
ND Duyen Hai III #1 and #2 given for 622MW in EVN, 600MW in PDP

ND Vin Tan IV #1 and #2 listed in 2018 in PDP, while #1 in 2017 by EVN

TD Da Nhim extension in 2018 listed for 80MW in EVN, 100MW in PDP

ND Duyen Hai III extension listed in 2018 by EVN, 2019 in PDP

O Mon IV prévu en 2021 dans le PDP, construction 2019-2022 dans EVN

TD Quang Trach 2 prévu 2028 et 2029 dans le PDP, 2023-2024 dans EVN

TD Tan Phuoc 1 et 2 prévus en 2023-2024 pour 1000MW chaque dans EVN pour, à partir de 2027 pour 2x600 chaque dans PDP.

Can Tho and Thu Duc are old power plants, units are 10-30 MW range,
 historically using Fuel Oil, some units are retrofit with gas turbines, EVN 2016 list them as "Oil fired gas turbines"
but count them in the "Gas" fuel on page 11. We differ and classify them as Oil capacity, hence 264MW discrepancy..

Historical capacity additions:
Column "year" is from various sources on internet
Columns "capacity" "name" and "owner" is from EVN annual report 2016
The last two 2015 lines for Renewable and Hydro are remaining agregates, we didn't look at opening dates of the dams under 200MW

Bac Lieu wind farm phase 2 counted as 2015 in EVN, not in PDP7 for 2016
