Objectives of the PDP7 A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hydro includes Large, medium and pumped storage hydropower",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"RenewableÂ includes small hydropower, wind power, solar power, biomass power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supply = Production + Import,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Import is net,,,,,*** EXPORT AS CSV WITH DEFAULT VALUES ***,,,,,,Keep numbers INTEGERS,,,,,,
