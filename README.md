Installation and use:

 The code is in Python 3.5
it imports  hashlib, sys, copy, functools  from the standard library
it imports  pandas, mathplotlib, numpy  from the scientific python core packages

The builds uses a standard  Makefile  with

  make         run the model, all sensitivity analysis to build all tables and figures.

  make test    perform regression tests, docstests, and scripted tests (if any)

  make reg_tests_reset   copy results tables from the current dir into tables.tocompare/

  make clean   delete results files

  make cleaner delete results files and Python cache files


Directory organization:

1. Files in data/ are raw data collected (PDF, XLS, web pages) from the web.

2. Intermediate CSV or TXT (when used), are also in data/

3. Files starting with data_X mostly make available the data found in data/X/

4. Files starting with an Upper case define the class with that name

5. Files starting with plan_ instanciate a PowerPlan object

6. Files starting with param_ instanciate a Parameter object

7. Files in  tables.tocompare are used for regression testing. Use "make reg_tests_reset" to populate/update it.

Expand the time horizon to two generations of coal power plants, about 80 years

Compute average age of early scrapping in CCS scenario
