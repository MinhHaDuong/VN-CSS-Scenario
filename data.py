Read the prepared data files

There are 3 data sources (PDP7A, EVN 2016 report, IEA statistics)
so we need to clarify column names.

 1/ Some include Imports in electricity "Production"
    Here we don't --it's clearly wrong-- and use these column names:
      Supply = Production + Imports

 2/ Another ambiguity is whether SmallHydro is included in "Hydro" or "Renewable"
    Here we do the former and use these column names:
      Hydro = BigHydro + SmallHydro
      BigHydro = LargeHydro + InterHydro
      Renewable = Wind + Solar + Biomass
      Renewable4 = Renewable + Small hydro

 3/ We do NOT include PumpedStorage in Hydro capacities

 4/ We define Import as net of Exports

 5/ In VN capacity stats, generation from fuel oil and from diesel is not clearly accounted for

 6/ Adding up fossil fuel generation capacities with renewable capacities is meaningless
    because the capacity factors are not comparable, neither are the investment costs
